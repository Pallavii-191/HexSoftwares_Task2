# Web Music Player 🎶

A single-page web application that functions as a simple music player, allowing users to play, pause, and navigate through a predefined playlist.

## 🌟 Features

  * **Playlist Display:** View a clear list of songs including **Title**, **Artist**, and **Duration**.
  * **Song Playback:** Play the selected song with real-time progress tracking.
  * **Playback Controls:**
      * ▶️ / ⏸️ **Play/Pause** button.
      * ⏭️ **Next** button to skip to the subsequent song.
      * ⏮️ **Previous** button to go back to the preceding song.

## 💻 Technologies Used

This project is built using foundational web technologies:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Structure and semantics (playlist elements, player controls). |
| **CSS3** | Styling (layout, aesthetics, responsive design). |
| **JavaScript** | Core functionality (audio handling, playback logic, DOM manipulation). |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) to run this application.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-music-player.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd web-music-player
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`** in your preferred web browser.

    > **Note:** Due to browser security restrictions on file paths, you may need a simple local server (like the Live Server VS Code extension) for some advanced features (like loading external audio files) to work correctly. For basic playback using embedded audio data, opening the file directly should suffice.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
web-music-player/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file for the player interface
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling
├── script.js           # JavaScript file for player logic and controls
└── assets/
    └── songs/          # Folder for audio files (e.g., .mp3, .ogg)
```

## 📝 Usage

1.  The **Playlist** is displayed on the screen.
2.  Click on a song in the playlist to **select** it.
3.  Use the **Play/Pause** button to control playback.
4.  Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to cycle through the playlist.
5.  The **progress bar** will update as the song plays.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

  * **Volume Control:** Add a slider to adjust the master volume.
  * **Seek Bar Interaction:** Allow users to click/drag the progress bar to scrub through the song.
  * **Shuffle/Repeat Modes:** Implement buttons for shuffling the playlist and repeating the current song or the entire playlist.
  * **Dynamic Playlist Loading:** Allow users to upload their own audio files.
  * **Responsive Design Improvements:** Enhance layout for smaller mobile devices.
